	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 30. 2024</p>
	<p>Signed: Kristófer Fannar Björnsson</p>
	<p>kristoferfannarb@gmail.com</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to PremKing. This Privacy Policy explains how the app collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use it. This is a personal project and not affiliated with any company. Additionally, I do not monetize this project in any way and it does not make any money.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>I collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Name and email address when you sign up using your Google account. This is linked to your account so that my app knows which account you are logging into and to identify the users within your league.</li>
        <li><strong>Guesses:</strong> The guesses you make for Premier League fixture results. This is for you to be able to create guesses throughout the season.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Method of Collection</h2>
    <p>I collect information through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google OAuth when you sign up using your Google account. This information is stored with your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>I use your information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allow you to login to your account.</li>
        <li>Save the guesses you make for Premier League fixture results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>I do not share your information with any third parties. I also do not collect any usage statistics or any other information.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>I store your data on a secure database server from Supabase, which is only accessible to my backend.</p>

    <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access and update your information by contacting me directly.</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your data by contacting me directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>I do not use cookies or other tracking technologies. I only save your session token securely within your device so that you do not need to constantly log in. The session token expires periodically, so you are required to login once in a while.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>I retain your data for as long as necessary to provide my services and comply with any legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>I do not transfer your data to any third parties.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, mostly if required from any changes (new features, better experience) in the app. I will notify you of any significant changes through the application.</p>

    <h2>12. Compliance with Laws</h2>
    <p>While not certified, I will do my best to follow GDPR regulations.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact me at kristoferfannarb@gmail.com.</p>
